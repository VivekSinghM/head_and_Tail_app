        <b>No Longer Human</b> is told in the form of notebooks left by one Ōba
        Yōzō (大庭葉蔵), a troubled man incapable of revealing his true self to
        others, and who, instead, maintains a facade of hollow jocularity. The
        work is made up of three chapters, or "memoranda", which chronicle the
        life of Ōba from his early childhood to his late twenties.

          <b>First Memorandum: </b>
          Overcome by an intense feeling of alienation and otherness and finding
          it nearly impossible to understand those who surround him who live in
          egoism and bad faith, Ōba can't help but resort to buffoonery in order
          to establish interpersonal relationships. He is sexually abused by a
          male servant and a female servant during his childhood, but decides
          that reporting it would be useless.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Second Memorandum: </b>
          Ōba becomes increasingly concerned over the potential penetrability of
          his cheerful facade by his schoolmate Takeichi, who sees through his
          false buffoonery. Ōba befriends him to prevent Takeichi from revealing
          his secret. As he shows Takeichi the ghost-like paintings of Amedeo
          Modigliani, he realizes that certain artists express the inner truth
          of human cruelty through their own trauma. Ōba paints a self-portrait
          inspired by these artists, which is so dreadful that he dares not show
          it to anyone except Takeichi, who esteems the picture. He neglects his
          university studies, out of fear of collective life. Influenced by a
          fellow artist, Horiki, whom he meets at a painting class, Ōba descends
          into a vicious pattern of drinking, smoking and harlotry, culminating
          in a one-night stand with a married woman with whom he attempts to
          commit double suicide via drowning. Though he survives, she dies,
          leaving him with nothing but an excruciating feeling of guilt.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Third Memorandum, Part One: </b>
          Ōba is expelled from university, and comes under the care of a friend
          of the family. He tries to have a normal relationship with a single
          mother, serving as a surrogate father to her little girl but abandons
          them in favor of living with the madam of a bar he patronizes. Since
          then he tries to believe the meaning of society for an individual is
          to escape out of fear of humanity. He drinks heavily, inspired by
          Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Later, he falls into a relationship with
          Yoshiko, a young and naive woman who wants him to stop drinking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Third Memorandum, Part Two: </b>
          Thanks to Yoshiko's grounding influence on his life, Ōba stops
          drinking and finds gainful work as a cartoonist. Then Horiki shows up,
          turning Ōba to self-destructive behavior again. Worse, at the moment
          of recalling Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky while he discusses the
          antonym of crime with Horiki, Ōba becomes estranged from his wife
          following an incident where she is sexually assaulted by a casual
          acquaintance. The ghastly terror and despair brought on by this
          incident leads Ōba to become an alcoholic and a morphine addict. He is
          eventually confined to a mental institution and, upon release, moves
          to an isolated place, concluding the story with numb self-reflection
          after profound despair.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-left">
        The story is bookended with two other, shorter chapters from the point
        of view of a neutral observer, who sees three photos of Ōba and
        eventually tracks down one of the characters mentioned in the notebooks
        who knew him personally. Ōba refers to himself throughout the book using
        the reflexive pronoun "Jibun" (自分), whereas the personal pronoun
        "Watashi" (私) is used both in the foreword and afterword to the book by
        the writer, whose name is unclear. The name "Ōba" is actually taken from
        one of Dazai's early works, The Flowers of Buffoonery (道化の華).
